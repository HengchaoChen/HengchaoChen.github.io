## Readings: Riemannian Geometry and Statistical Machine Learning

[Riemannian Geometry and Statistical Machine Learning](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~lebanon/pub/thesis/thesis.pdf) is the Ph.D. thesis of [Guy Lebanon](http://theanalysisofdata.com/), CMU. This page includes the slides presenting this thesis. 

### A brief introduction
There are two fundamental spaces in machine learning: the data space $\mathcal{X}$ and the model space $\Theta$. Statistical machine learning algorithms learn a model $\theta\in\Theta$ based on a training set. These algorithms either explicitly or implicitly assume a specific geometries of the data space $\mathcal{X}$ and the model space $\Theta$. In applications, data and model space are rarely Euclidean spaces, but they are smooth and locally Euclidean, which motivates us to model them by Riemannian Geometry. By studying the relationship between learning algorithms and the geometries of data and model spaces, we can gain considerable insights into the algorithms and design new powerful learning algorithms as well.

### Some background materials

You may turn to the classical monographs such as [Introduction to Smooth Manifolds, John M.Lee](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4419-9982-5) and [Riemannian Geometry, do Carmo](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-642-18855-8) for the mathematical foundation of Riemannian Geometry. Moreover, you may turn to a deeper introduction to the mathematics around Riemannian Geometry, such as [The Laplacian on a Riemannian manifold, an introduction to analysis on manifolds, Steven Rosenberg](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/laplacian-on-a-riemannian-manifold/56F18C2AB0A765A91892E164079A3B74), which are useful in some parts of this thesis. Combining geometry and information, Shun-ichi Amari developed a related area called information geometry, and you may turn to his monagraph [Information Geometry and Its Applications, Amari](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-97798-0) for details. Also, you may find it interesting to read other monographs studying the relationship between geometry & statistics, such as [Geometrical Foundations of Asymptotic Inference, Kass and Vos](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9781118165980).

### Slides (.html documents by *slidy_presentation* in Rmarkdown):
