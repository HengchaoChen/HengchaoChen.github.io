This series of readings is based on Guy Lebanon's Ph.D. thesis [Riemannian Geometry and Statistical Machine Learning](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~lebanon/pub/thesis/thesis.pdf). For the mathematical foundations of Riemannian Geometry, you may turn to the classical monographs such as [Introduction to Smooth Manifolds, John M.Lee](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4419-9982-5) and [Riemannian Geometry, do Carmo](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-642-18855-8). For specific topics involved in the thesis, you may turn to a deeper introduction to the mathematics around Riemannian Geometry, such as [The Laplacian on a Riemannian manifold, an introduction to analysis on manifolds, Steven Rosenberg](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/laplacian-on-a-riemannian-manifold/56F18C2AB0A765A91892E164079A3B74). This thesis is absolutely not the first one to combine the geometry and statistics (or more widely information science). In fact, a related area that has been developed by Shun-ichi Amari is information geometry and you may find more details about this area in Amari's monagraph [Information Geometry and Its Applications, Amari](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-97798-0). Also, you may find [Geometrical Foundations of Asymptotic Inference, Kass and Vos](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9781118165980) interesting.

This page is for the collection of my (future) slides in reading the thesis. Starting from 26th, January, 2021, I will upload one slide below every two weeks. Hope some of you may find it useful or interesting.
