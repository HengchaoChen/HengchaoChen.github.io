# Readings: Riemannian Geometry and Statistical Machine Learning
[Riemannian Geometry and Statistical Machine Learning](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~lebanon/pub/thesis/thesis.pdf) is the Ph.D. thesis of [Guy Lebanon](http://theanalysisofdata.com/), CMU. This page includes the slides presenting this thesis. 

## A brief introduction
There are two fundamental spaces in machine learning: the data space $\mathcal{X}$ and the model space $\Theta$. Statistical machine learning algorithms learn a model $\theta\in\Theta$ based on a training set. These algorithms either explicitly or implicitly assume a specific geometries of the data space $\mathcal{X}$ and the model space $\Theta$. In applications, data and model space are rarely Euclidean spaces, but they are smooth and locally Euclidean, which motivates us to model them by Riemannian Geometry. By studying the relationship between learning algorithms and the geometries of data and model spaces, we can gain considerable insights into the algorithms and design new powerful learning algorithms as well.

## Some background materials
- The classical monographs [Introduction to Smooth Manifolds, John M.Lee](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4419-9982-5) and [Riemannian Geometry, do Carmo](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-642-18855-8) are excellent textbooks for the theory of Riemannian Geometry. 
- [The Laplacian on a Riemannian manifold, an introduction to analysis on manifolds, Steven Rosenberg](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/laplacian-on-a-riemannian-manifold/56F18C2AB0A765A91892E164079A3B74), a deeper introduction to the mathematics around Riemannian Geometry, is useful in some parts of this thesis. 
- [Information Geometry and Its Applications, Amari](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-97798-0), an area combining geometry and information. 
- [Geometrical Foundations of Asymptotic Inference, Kass and Vos](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9781118165980), another monograph studying the relationship between geometry & statistics.
- [Nonparametric statistics on manifolds and their applications to object data analysis](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282364732_Nonparametric_Statistics_on_Manifolds_and_Their_Application_to_Object_Data_Analysis), a monograph combining manifolds & nonparametric statistics.

*Starting from **January 26, 2021**, I will upload one slide every two weeks. These are .html documents created by *slidy_presentation* in Rmarkdown.  
**Acquisition Method:** **1.** click and download the document, **2.** open in the browser: Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome.  
**More operations:** **C** - show table of contents; **F** - toggle display of the footer; **A** - toggle display of the current vs all slides; **S** - make fonts smaller; **B** - make fonts bigger.*
