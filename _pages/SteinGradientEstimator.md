# Readings: Gradient Estimators for Implicit Models
[Gradient Estimators for Implicit Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07107), Yingzhen Li and Richard E. Turner, proposed a new gradient estimator, called the Stein Gradient Estimator, for implicit models. This page collects the slide and the Python notebook in my course representation of this paper. The course is [Research Topics in Statistical Machine Learning: Minimization Expectation](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~cmaddis/courses/sta4273_w21/).
