Hengchao Chen (Archer) is a boy who just struggled to graduate from the University of Science and Technology of China in 2020. Fortunately and somehow unfortunately, he is going to pursue a Ph.D. degree in Statistics in Zoom University, China. His research interests include data science, distributed learning, high-dimensional statistics, information geometry. These are just research interests since publications do not exist right now. Recently, he enjoyed working on a project relevant to Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19), which may not be reated to his possible Ph.D. dissertation. He learned the saying 'Rubbish in, Rubbish out' over and over again during this project. To graduate in time, however, he has to go back to the original research topics, hoping to make some progress like any PhD candidate.


Apparently, this website is just established, and the words are funny and away from serious. Hope I have time to improve it in the foreseeable future. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any suggestions.
