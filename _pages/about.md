I am a boy who just struggled to graduate from the University of Science and Technology of China in 2020. Fortunately and somewhat unfortunately, I am going to pursue a Ph.D. degree in Statistics in Zoom University, China. My research interests include data science, distributed learning, high-dimensional statistics, optimization, information geometry. These are just research interests since publications do not exist right now. <br>

Recently, I have been working on a project relevant to Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19), which may not be related to my Ph.D. dissertation. I learned the saying 'Rubbish in, Rubbish out' over and over again during this project. To graduate in time, however, I have to go back to the original research topics, hoping to make some progress like any PhD candidate. <br>

Apparently, this website is just established, and the words are funny and away from serious. Hope I have time to improve it in the foreseeable future. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any suggestions.

Recent Focuses:
- reading thesis of Guy Lebanon, a Ph.D. graduated from CMU, [Riemannian Geometry and Statistical Machine Learning](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~lebanon/pub/thesis/thesis.pdf). As a plan, I will make some slides every two weeks starting from 26th, January, 2021. For those who are interested, you can find these [slides](/riegeostatml/) here. 
- listening to others' presentation on the Jerry Li's Ph.D. thesis [Principled Approaches to Robust Machine Learning and Beyond](https://jerryzli.github.io/robust-ml-fall19.html).
- listening to others' presentation on the paper [Spectral Methods for Data Science: A Statistical Perspective](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.08496.pdf). 
- an interesting seminar-type course [Minimizing Expectation](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~cmaddis/courses/sta4273_w21/).
- a [project](https://github.com/HengchaoChen/Covid-19) related to COVID-19. PS: the repository is currently private.
