Hengchao Chen (Archer) is a boy who just struggled to graduate from the University of Science and Technology of China in 2020. He is going to pursue a Ph.D. degree in Statistics in Zoom University, China. His research interests include data science, distributed learning, high-dimensional statistics, information geometry. Recently, he enjoyed working on a project relevant to Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19), which may not be reated to his possible Ph.D. dissertation. To graduate in time, therefore, he plans to go back to the original research topics. Apparently, this website is just established, and the words are funny and away from serious. Hope I have time to improve it in the foreseeable future. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any suggestions.
